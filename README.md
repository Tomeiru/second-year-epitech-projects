# Mathieu Brujan's Second-Year Epitech Projects

‚ù§Ô∏è First of all, I need to thank you for the interest you have in my past! ‚ù§Ô∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è However, I must warn you that any code written in this repository does **NOT** represent my **current** abilities and that I've evolved a lot since then. ‚ö†Ô∏è

üìà Despite this, I still think it's a nice way to see how I've progressed since the beginning. üìà

You'll be able to find in this repository every project I created (with the help of a lot of teammates!) during my second year of study at Epitech (2021-2022). Most projects have been created in C and C++, there are still some exceptions like every Mathematics projects that have been done in different languages (See [Les maths en 9 languages](https://github.com/Tomeiru/les-maths-en-9-languages)) and others that you'll be able to see later in this README.
